# Weather Challenge
  
This project was built with Next.js, based on a proposal from [#devchallenges](https://legacy.devchallenges.io/challenges/mM1UIenRhK808W8qmLWv). The web application obtains the data from openweathermap API, delivering current weather information and a 5 days forecast for the selected location. Moreover uses geolocation to detect userÂ´s coordinates. The search form gets the data from geocoding API, providing up to 5 location results.
